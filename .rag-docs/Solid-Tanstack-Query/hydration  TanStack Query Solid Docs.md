## dehydrate

](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/solid/reference/hydration#dehydrate)

dehydrate creates a frozen representation of a cache that can later be hydrated with HydrationBoundary or hydrate. This is useful for passing prefetched queries from server to client or persisting queries to localStorage or other persistent locations. It only includes currently successful queries by default.

```javascript
import { dehydrate } from '@tanstack/solid-query'

const dehydratedState = dehydrate(queryClient, {
  shouldDehydrateQuery,
  shouldDehydrateMutation,
})
```

**Options**

-   client: QueryClient
    -   **Required**
    -   The queryClient that should be dehydrated
-   options: DehydrateOptions
    -   Optional
    -   shouldDehydrateMutation: (mutation: Mutation) => boolean
        -   Optional
        -   Whether to dehydrate mutations.
        -   The function is called for each mutation in the cache
            -   Return true to include this mutation in dehydration, or false otherwise
        -   Defaults to only including paused mutations
        -   If you would like to extend the function while retaining the default behavior, import and execute defaultShouldDehydrateMutation as part of the return statement
    -   shouldDehydrateQuery: (query: Query) => boolean
        -   Optional
        -   Whether to dehydrate queries.
        -   The function is called for each query in the cache
            -   Return true to include this query in dehydration, or false otherwise
        -   Defaults to only including successful queries
        -   If you would like to extend the function while retaining the default behavior, import and execute defaultShouldDehydrateQuery as part of the return statement
    -   serializeData?: (data: any) => any A function to transform (serialize) data during dehydration.
    -   shouldRedactErrors?: (error: unknown) => boolean
        -   Optional
        -   Whether to redact errors from the server during dehydration.
        -   The function is called for each error in the cache
            -   Return true to redact this error, or false otherwise
        -   Defaults to redacting all errors

**Returns**

-   dehydratedState: DehydratedState
    -   This includes everything that is needed to hydrate the queryClient at a later point
    -   You **should not** rely on the exact format of this response, it is not part of the public API and can change at any time
    -   This result is not in serialized form, you need to do that yourself if desired

### Limitations

](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/solid/reference/hydration#limitations)

Some storage systems (such as browser [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)) require values to be JSON serializable. If you need to dehydrate values that are not automatically serializable to JSON (like Error or undefined), you have to serialize them for yourself. Since only successful queries are included per default, to also include Errors, you have to provide shouldDehydrateQuery, e.g.:

```javascript
// server
const state = dehydrate(client, { shouldDehydrateQuery: () => true }) // to also include Errors
const serializedState = mySerialize(state) // transform Error instances to objects

// client
const state = myDeserialize(serializedState) // transform objects back to Error instances
hydrate(client, state)
```

## hydrate

](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/solid/reference/hydration#hydrate)

hydrate adds a previously dehydrated state into a cache.

```javascript
import { hydrate } from '@tanstack/solid-query'

hydrate(queryClient, dehydratedState, options)
```

**Options**

-   client: QueryClient
    -   **Required**
    -   The queryClient to hydrate the state into
-   dehydratedState: DehydratedState
    -   **Required**
    -   The state to hydrate into the client
-   options: HydrateOptions
    -   Optional
    -   defaultOptions: DefaultOptions
        -   Optional
        -   mutations: MutationOptions The default mutation options to use for the hydrated mutations.
        -   queries: QueryOptions The default query options to use for the hydrated queries.
        -   deserializeData?: (data: any) => any A function to transform (deserialize) data before it is put into the cache.
    -   queryClient?: QueryClient
        -   Use this to use a custom QueryClient. Otherwise, the one from the nearest context will be used.

### Limitations

](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/solid/reference/hydration#limitations-1)

If the queries you're trying to hydrate already exist in the queryCache, hydrate will only overwrite them if the data is newer than the data present in the cache. Otherwise, it will **not** get applied.
