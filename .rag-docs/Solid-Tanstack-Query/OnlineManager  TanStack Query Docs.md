The OnlineManager manages the online state within TanStack Query. It can be used to change the default event listeners or to manually change the online state.

> Per default, the onlineManager assumes an active network connection, and listens to the online and offline events on the window object to detect changes.

> In previous versions, navigator.onLine was used to determine the network status. However, it doesn't work well in Chromium based browsers. There are [a lot of issues](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=navigator.online) around false negatives, which lead to Queries being wrongfully marked as offline.

> To circumvent this, we now always start with online: true and only listen to online and offline events to update the status.

> This should reduce the likelihood of false negatives, however, it might mean false positives for offline apps that load via serviceWorkers, which can work even without an internet connection.
