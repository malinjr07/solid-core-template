### First-Class TypeScript Support

TanStack Form touts first-class TypeScript support with outstanding autocompletion, excellent generic throughput and inferred types everywhere possible.

This results in fewer runtime errors, increased code maintainability, and a smoother development experience

to help you confidently build robust and type-safe form solutions that scale.

### Headless and Framework Agnostic

Form's headless and framework agnostic approach ensures maximum flexibility and broad compatibility with many front-end frameworks, or no framework at all. By both supplying and encouraging a headless approach to your forms, building custom reusable form components tailored to your application's needs

requires little abstraction and keeps your code modular, simple and composable.

### Granular Reactive Performance

When it comes to performance, TanStack Form delivers amazing speed and control, but without the cruft, boilerplate, or abstractions. With granularly reactive APIs at its core,

only relevant components are updated when the form state changes.

The end result? A faster UI, happy users, and zero worries about performance.

### No dependencies. All the Features.

### Less code, fewer edge cases.

Instead of encouraging hasty abstractions and hook-focused APIs, TanStack Form embraces composition where it counts by giving you headless APIs via components (and hooks if you want them of course). TanStack Form is designed to be used directly in your components and UI. This means less code, fewer edge cases, and deeper control over your UI. Try it out with one of the examples below!
