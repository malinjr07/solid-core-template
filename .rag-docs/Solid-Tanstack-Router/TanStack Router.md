### Typesafe & powerful, yet familiarly simple

TanStack Router builds on modern routing patterns made popular by other tools, but has been re-engineered from the ground up to be

100% typesafe without compromising on DX. You _can_ have your cake and eat it too!

### Built-in Data Fetching with Caching

Hoist your data fetching and avoid waterfalls with TanStack Router's loader API and get

instant navigations with built-in caching and automatic preloading. Need something more custom? Router's API is designed to work with your favorite client-side cache libraries!

### Search Param APIs to make your state-manager jealous

Instead of throwing you to the URLSearchParam wolves, TanStack Router outfits you with state-manager-grade search param APIs. With

schemas, validation, full type-safety and pre/post manipulation, you can manage your state in the URL and easily sync it to your state-manager of choice.
